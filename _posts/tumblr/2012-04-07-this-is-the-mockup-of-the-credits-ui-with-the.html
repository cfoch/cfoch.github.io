<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_m23euuuR5H1rt6qe9o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is the mockup of the Credits UI with the Plain Text UI. The credits viewer display how the effect looks like. In the &ldquo;Content&rdquo; you add the text wich will be showed at Credits Viewer. Then you could set the font type, text color, text spacing, background color, speeding of the displaying, and the direction of the effect: Up / Down, Down / Up. So&hellip; that&rsquo;s my first mockuped idea.</p>
