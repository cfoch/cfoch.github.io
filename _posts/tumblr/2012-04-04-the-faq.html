<p><strong>What is cfoch-dev?</strong><br/>cfoch-dev is a blog focussed the other side of my life: the free software development. In this blog I pretend to comment about my geek life and programming experiencies.<br/><br/><strong>Why do I program?</strong><br/>Because I get angry easily when I can’t see a specific tool into a program. Therefore I think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that program can do this and that&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t like to wait for some unlikely actualization, then I program. If there was somebody who can develop all I’d want that some software should have, probably, I wouldn’t make software.<br/><br/><strong>Why english?</strong><br/>Actually, I speak spanish. But because I’m planning to participate in the Google Summer of Code, I’ll need write my project advances in a language wich the most of people can understand. If you don&rsquo;t understand the content of this blog, it&rsquo;s because my english is too bad or because you don&rsquo;t read/speak english.<br/><br/><strong>Is there any personal blog?</strong><br/>Yes. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://cfoch.tumblr.com" title="http://cfoch.tumblr.com" target="_self">http://cfoch.tumblr.com</a><br/><br/><strong>Why do I write it?</strong><br/>I&rsquo;m boring and I don&rsquo;t nothing to do<br/><br/><br/></p>
