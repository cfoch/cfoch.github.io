<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Fabián Orccón. I&rsquo;ve been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2014 for GNOME with Pitivi. My project consists on adding an image-sequence feature to Pitivi. The usecases could be creating stop-motion films or a 2D animation for example.<br/>The idea of this feature came to my mind when I wanted to film a homemade stop-motion movie with my sister. I had Ubuntu, and by that time Pitivi was the video-editing tool by default. I realized that Pitivi doesn&rsquo;t have this feature implemented, and I wanted to do it.<br/>I&rsquo;m not the expert in the arts of cinematography. I was talking with Pitivi people and Bassam Kurdali, director of the first open movie, about how Pitivi could handle this feature. After mixing and organizing ideas I have this mockup. It is just a draft; I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m missing something. <br/><br/><strong>I would like you to tell me how would you like this feature should work. Your opinion as user is so important. Pitivi wants to be the best option for you!</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0x_tSS6M-6HVUhqQWFDdW1NVTA/edit"><img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/5b3591ede46f8ef965165fd6cf913dc8/tumblr_inline_n4lcai4Bwe1r9iku9.png"/></a></p>
