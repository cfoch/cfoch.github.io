<p>(Midterm) Exams are near. My friends and I had to explain our database model to the professor. There were some errors in the data type of the fields. But nothing dangerous. We were using ERWIN (over ORACLE). Actually, I don’t like ERWIN, but I had to use it. Anyway, the implementation in gtravel-webapp will be different to it. I am using Django+MySQL. I’ve been learning it and writting code at the same time. I was looking for some libraries/modules to verify IBAN, SWIFT/BIC codes and phonenumbers. Finally, I think I will use them.<br/><br/>I’ve been taking about 40-60 minutes per day to write some documentation  or code related to the project. But I think this week I’m going to be very bussy. What is really complicated in the carreer in my university is the fact we have at least 3 graded practice test each week. <br/><br/>Read you!<br/><br/><a href="https://github.com/cfoch/gtravel-webapp">https://github.com/cfoch/gtravel-webapp</a></p>
