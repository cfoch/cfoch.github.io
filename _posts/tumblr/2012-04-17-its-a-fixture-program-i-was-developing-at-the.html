<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_m2mae3KpcM1rt6qe9o1_1280.png"/><br/><p>It&rsquo;s a fixture program I was developing at the last summer. I was writting code about 12 hours per day in a week. I stoped it, because I got tired and I saw I was becoming a nerd.</p>
<p>The code it&rsquo;s absolutely disordered, if you could make it better, thanks :) It&rsquo;s missing a positions table.</p>
