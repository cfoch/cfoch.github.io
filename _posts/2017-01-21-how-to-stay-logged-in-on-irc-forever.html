<p>You may have different reasons why you want to stay (always) connected to an IRC channel. Maybe you did a question and you are waiting for a response but you have other things to do and you want to shut your notebook down. Or maybe you are the maintainer of a program and you would like to see all the questions your users did during the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Firstly, you will need a <strong>cloud service</strong> with Linux. Then you will have to install and set up 'weechat' and 'tmux'.</p>
<p><strong>Installing Weechat</strong><br />
Weechat is a text-based IRC client easy-to-use.</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install weechat</pre>
<p><strong>Installing tmux</strong><br />
tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to have multiple terminal sessions to be accessed from a single screen. You can switch between these terminals.</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install weechat</pre>
<p>After installing tmux and weechat, start a new tmux session. We will call to this session ircsession.</p>
<pre>$ tmux new -s ircsession</pre>

<p>Then you will open weechat.</p>
<pre>$ weechat</pre>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36" style="width: 100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screenshot-from-2017-01-21-13-46-16" alt="" /><br />
In weechat, you can connect to the IRC server and channel you want. For example, let's connect to #gstreamer in irc.freenode.net!</p>
<pre>/set irc.server.freenode.nicks "your_nickname"
/connect freenode
/join #gstreamer
</pre>
<p>If you got an error about SASL, do this:</p>
<pre>/set irc.server.freenode.sasl_username "your_nickname"
/set irc.server.freenode.sasl_password "xxxxxxx"
</pre>
<p>That's it. You can close the terminal window when you want. if you want to see your IRC tmux session again later, type:</p>
<pre>tmux attach -t ircsession
</pre>
<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>
