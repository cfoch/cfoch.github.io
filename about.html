## About

My name is Fabián Orccón *(aka cfoch)*. I am a graduated student of Informatics Engineering (in the PUCP university) who is very passionate about FLOSS from a young age. I am a GNOME member and a Pitivi developer. The first intellectual hobby I have is coding, reading about economics and pick up stocks from time to time. Well... when not doing something that nerdy I may be playing random notes on my guitar. Ah! I forgot it. I am paleo.
