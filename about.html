## About

My name is Fabián Orccón *(aka cfoch)*. I am a peruvian student of Informatics Engineering in the PUCP university who is very passionate about FLOSS from a young age. I am a GNOME member and a Pitivi developer. The first intellectual hobby I have is coding and the second one is looking up for bargains in the stock market sometimes. Well... when not doing something that nerdy I may be playing Ultimate Frisbee or playing SuperTuxKart. Ah! I forgot it. I am paleo.
